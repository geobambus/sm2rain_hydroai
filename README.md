## 1. Overview

SM2RAIN-HydroAI provides a unified, reproducible, and operational-ready environment for SM2RAIN-based rainfall estimation. The repository supports automatic data acquisition, preprocessing, and execution of multiple SM2RAIN algorithm versions, enabling consistent hydrologic analysis across time, regions, and sensors.

This framework is intended for research, development, and government-level operational collaboration.

## 2. Purpose

This repository was developed to:

(1) Maintain up-to-date implementations of SM2RAIN algorithms  
(2) Automatically download and manage required satellite and auxiliary data  
(3) Provide a standardized pipeline for rainfall inversion from soil moisture  
(4) Support reproducible research and operational testing  
(5) Enable collaboration with agencies such as KIHS

## 3. Algorithms Included

The repository integrates multiple generations of SM2RAIN:

(1) Original SM2RAIN algorithm proposed by **Lucca Brocca**  
(2) SM2RAIN-NRT and advanced operational variants  
(3) SM2RAIN-NSF development versions  
(4) SM2RAIN-GA (genetic algorithm optimized parameterization)  
(5) Experimental AI-assisted SM2RAIN extensions (optional modules)

Each version is modular and can be selected depending on research or operational needs.
